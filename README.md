# Introduction  

The project about creating an SPHFluid using a particle system for simulate Tsunami Phoneme.

This project froked from [qoopen0815 Repo](https://github.com/qoopen0815/SPHFluid) 

# Abstract

The project involves creating an SPHFluid using a particle system in Unity, without relying on any third-party libraries for physics. Unity will be used solely for rendering and drawing, without utilizing existing models to enhance the realism of the scene.

The project aims to depict a tsunami scene in the middle of the sea, generating realistic waves through the interaction of particles. The goal is to accurately simulate the movement of the sea and collisions, while ensuring that the visual representation (color and projection) resembles an actual view of the sea.

To achieve this, shaders will be employed to calculate the physics equations, Voronoi will be used to create the sea view, and collision equations will be implemented to handle particle interactions with boundaries.
